Based on Surface from 2017.

Here you can find bugfixes, updated dependencies and other stuff as I encounter problems using this in a project of mine. I also think I will stick to the no js philosophy cause that's the reason why I want to use it.

I do not plan on creating yet another Material Framework... that's why it is called NYAMF

Check the original documentation [here](http://mildrenben.github.io/surface).
